**Big bang theory theme lyrics**

Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started, wait The earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool Neanderthals developed tools We built a wall (we built the pyramids) Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries That all started with the big bang! Hey!

Since the dawn of man is really not that long As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song A fraction of a second and the elements were made The bipeds stood up straight, the dinosaurs all met their fate They tried to leap but they were late And they all died (they froze their asses off) The oceans and Pangea, see ya wouldn't wanna be ya Set in motion by the same big bang! It all started with the big bang!

It's expanding ever outward but one day It will cause the stars to go the other way Collapsing ever inward, we won't be here, it won't be hurt Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang!

Australopithecus would really have been sick of us Debating how we're here, they're catching deer (we're catching viruses) Religion or astronomy (Descartes or Deuteronomy) It all started with the big bang!

Music and mythology, Einstein and astrology It all started with the big bang! It all started with the big bang!
